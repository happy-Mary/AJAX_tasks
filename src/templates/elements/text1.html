<p>Since cats first got their adorable claws into us about 9,500 years ago, humans have had a love affair with felines. Today more than 80 million cats reside in U.S. homes, with an estimated three cats for every dog on the planet. (Watch a video about the
    secret lives of cats.) Yet there's still a lot we don't know about our feline friends—including what they think of their owners. John Bradshaw is a cat-behavior expert at the University of Bristol and the author of the new book Cat Sense. After observing
    pet cats for several years, he's come to an intriguing conclusion: They don't really understand us the way dogs do. Bradshaw recently shared some of his insights with National Geographic. How did you get into cat behavior? For the first 20 years of
    my career I studied olfactory [smell] behavior in invertebrates.</p>
<p> I've always been fascinated by this other world that animals live in—primarily of odor, which is dogs' primary sense. So in the early 1980s I started working on dog behavior. [Later] I very quickly became fascinated with cats, and what their idea of the
    world is compared to the one we have. What do you do in your research? A lot of observation—watching groups of cats to see how they interact with one another and deducing their social structure. [I watch] cats in colonies that are free-ranging, and
    in animal shelters where quite a number will be housed together—you get interesting dynamics [when new cats are introduced]. I've also done slightly more manipulative things, such as studying the way cats play with toys, or testing cat [behaviors]
    at different times of the day. [I also observe] relationships with owners, interviewing them and giving them questionnaires to find out how they perceive their cats. Why did you conclude that cats don't "get us" the way dogs do? There's been a lot
    of research with dogs and how dogs interact with people. [It's] become very clear that dogs perceive us as being different than themselves: As soon as they see a human, they change their behavior. The way a dog plays with a human is completely different
    from [the way it plays] with a dog.</p>
<p>We've yet to discover anything about cat behavior that suggests they have a separate box they put us in when they're socializing with us. They obviously know we're bigger than them, but they don't seem to have adapted their social behavior much. Putting
    their tails up in the air, rubbing around our legs, and sitting beside us and grooming us are exactly what cats do to each other. (Also see "How Cats and People Grew to Love Each Other.") I've read articles where you've said cats think of us as big,
    stupid cats. Is that accurate? No. In the book [I say] that cats behave toward us in a way that's indistinguishable from [how] they would act toward other cats. They do think we're clumsy: Not many cats trip over people, but we trip over cats. But
    I don't think they think of us as being dumb and stupid, since cats don't rub on another cat that's inferior to them. (See "Cats Use 'Irresistible' Purr-Whine to Get Their Way.")</p>
